# React Counter App with Confetti

Welcome to the React Counter App with Confetti! This simple React application allows you to increment a counter by clicking a button. However, there's a twist â€“ a random target number has been generated. If you manage to reach this target by continuously clicking the increment button, confetti will shower the screen, and the counter will reset.

## Features

- **Increment Counter:** Click the button to increase the counter.
- **Random Target:** A random target number is generated for an added challenge.
- **Confetti Celebration:** Witness a confetti explosion when you reach the target number.
- **Reset Counter:** After the confetti celebration, the counter resets to zero.
